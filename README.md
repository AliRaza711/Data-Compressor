Data Compression Tool Overview
Introduction
-This innovative data compression tool, developed in C—a primary and fast programming language—utilizes a straightforward binary encoding scheme to effectively reduce the size of text files. By converting alphabetical characters into binary representations (1's and 0's), this tool can compress a 1 MB text file to approximately 250 KB in optimal scenarios, with a worst-case compression size of 500 KB.

Key Features
-Efficient Encoding: The tool employs a simple yet effective logic to map each character in the text to a unique binary code, optimizing storage without compromising data integrity.
-High Compression Ratio: Capable of compressing large text files by up to 75% in ideal conditions, while ensuring a maximum output size of 500 KB for less compressible content.
-User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, enabling users to compress and decompress files with minimal effort.
-Fast Processing: The compression and decompression processes are executed quickly, ensuring minimal downtime for users.

Applications
-Data Storage: Ideal for organizations looking to save space on servers or local drives.
-Data Transmission: Facilitates faster uploads and downloads by reducing file sizes, making it suitable for applications involving large amounts of text data.
-Archiving: Perfect for maintaining large volumes of text files in a compressed format for long-term storage.

Conclusion
-This data compression tool represents a reliable and effective solution for reducing the size of text files, making it an essential utility for anyone dealing with large amounts of textual data.
